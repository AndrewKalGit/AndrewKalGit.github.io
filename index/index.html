  <h2>My trip to a local nature reserve!</h2>
  <p> This was one of my unexpected favorite trips. Not only was the lake beautiful it really complimented the scenary
    in genearl. There was never a lack of fun walking trails. I loved it so much I came back and packed my favorite
    picnic food and took pictures!

  <h2>A favorite hobby of mine~</h2>
  <p>Imagine sweat, nerves, and adrenaline all resonating through your body and nothing you are doing is able to calm
    it down. Except, beating your opponent down with a various types of punches. Boxing is a great stress reliever and
    a dangerous one nonetheless. As they say we don't play boxing.</p>

  <h2>Why I deicided to take up Boxing.</h2>
  <p>As someone who often struggles with a deep thinking mind it's hard to be on the same page as everyone else.
    Boxing offered me that way to almost forcefully be in the zone and the same page as... well at least as my
    opponents and coach. At the same time the ring kind of reminds me of my head and my issues. Everyone is always
    supporting you, but when it comes to the real deal you're alone just you and the problem at hand. The side talking
    and cheering just sounds like white noise and nothing but your actions will save you in the moment and define you.
